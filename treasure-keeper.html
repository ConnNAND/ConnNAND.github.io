            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>Created for the 2023 SSU Fall jam, this fantasy desk job simulator has you approving or denying funding requests from members of the kingdom, but be careful not to anger the wrong person.</p>
            <p>My primary contributions were in project management, story progression, writing, and sound design.</p>
            <h1>Accomplishments & Lessons Learned</h1>
            <p>When first starting the jam, I wanted to be able to focus primarily on the sound design of our project. However, the scope of what we had planned made it apparent that we would need all hands on deck if we were to finish everything we wanted, so it ended up taking a bit of a back seat until we got all of our major systems in place.</p>
            <p>Thankfully we had time for me to come back and begin sprucing things up outside of the bare-minimum interactions; objects were able to have different sounds based on if they were picked up or placed down, there is an ambient room tone with a candle flicker to set the mood, I even got to play around a bit with fantasy creatures as one of the drawers features a dragon that was originally going to be used as a shredder, as well as a fun idea we had for a sort of "night rooster" that signals the end of the day.</p>
            <p>Our biggest problem was biting off more than we could chew. While what we managed to get done works, the time constraints left us cutting features and working nail-bitingly close to the deadline just to get our minimum viable product done. Adjusting scope to fit the skills of your team is my biggest takeaway from this project.</p>
