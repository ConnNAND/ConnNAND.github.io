            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>This was originally created as a part of my course work for a class introducing us to game engines, however I continued to work on the game after the assignment, adding new features, modes, and mechanics. The core of the game is based on a fusion of Sonic Adventure and Kirby Air Ride's City Trial mode. In Rascal Rumble, your goal is to run around an open environment cracking open boxes and collecting fruit to give to your rascal, increasing their stats as a result. Once time runs out, all of the trained rascals are sent to a random race course where they use what they learned to try and reach the end as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p>Once you finish a race, you are also given the option to save your rascal, this lets you play a mini-game later in order to improve their stats further and eventually race other pre-trained rascals.</p>
            <h1>Accomplishments & Lessons Learned</h1>
            <p>Rascal Rumble is my first project that was entirely mine, and it served as a huge sandbox for me to explore ideas for mechanics as well as features of Godot that I had hardly touched before. </p>
            <p>This is what I accredit my knowledge of Godot to, without Rascal Rumble I would not have been able to find the drive to learn so much about the engine and making games in general. With this game behind me now and the skills and knowledge I acquired added to my tool belt, it truly feels like with enough time any idea is possible.</p>
            <p>It also gave me practice with some aspects of games that I was unfamiliar with, some of these being particle effects, animations, local multiplayer, and mobile support.</p>
            <p>Rascal Rumble finally gave me the opportunity to execute on ideas I've had running around in my head for a long time, and while I managed to include them all, it also led to me realizing the importance of breaking up your code and not making too many assumptions. As the project grew and grew, it became harder to maintain and add new things without stepping on the toes of something created before. This eventually led to me choosing to begin recreating the game from scratch in Godot 4 using the lessons learned from the first iteration to write cleaner code as a solid foundation.</p>
            <p>The revised version of the project was going well, however while still having classes and working at the time, managing all of these became too time consuming and I eventually put the remake on the back-burner. I may revisit the idea as the project files have been backed up, though my current efforts are being put towards other projects.</p>
