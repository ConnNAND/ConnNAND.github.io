            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>This project was my team's entry into the 2023 Global Game Jam. In Root Force, you must survive wave after wave of living plants by defeating them with your chain-whacker. Aim high for tall enemies and aim low for short ones, all while trying to keep your distance and avoiding getting caught surrounded or cornered.</p>
            <p>My main takeaway from Root Force is the value in team collaboration, with everything moving smoothly when everyone is comfortable communicating.</p>
            <p>My primary contributions were the player controller, sound design, project management, and your cute, hungry, son.</p>
            <h1>Accomplishments & Lessons Learned</h1>
            <p>This project had me balancing teaching with creating. Most of my group had not touched a game engine until this point so I showed them the ropes while assigning work based on what they should have been able to handle, all the while making contributions of my own.</p>
            <p>I managed to program the player controller, help out with the map, and create the AI for your son, on top of the sound design.</p>
            <p>Notably for the sound design, the "chain-whacker" that the player wields was the first time I needed to create looping audio outside of music, so figuring out how to have it wind-up, sustain, and release was a bit of a challenge, but it turned out alright. It also changes pitch while carving into enemies, a delightful little touch that added to the immersion.</p>
