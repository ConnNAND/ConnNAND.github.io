            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>Gnomad is a 2D adventure platformer with "bouncing ball" combat. Explore the vibrant world of the Sunken Forest while encountering curious creatures and strange monsters, all in search of your pet frog.</p>
            <p>This project began 1 year before I joined the team as the rest of the group's senior capstone. After graduation, one member left the team and I came to fill their place as the rest of us are pushing for a full Steam release.</p>
            <p>While being a founding member of JollyWare as a company, my role in the project is as the sound design lead, as well as assisting in general programming.</p>
            <h1>Accomplishments & Lessons Learned</h1>
            <p>My contributions so far outside of the business and brainstorming scope include helping with refactoring old code for enemies, adding new enemies, creating NPCs using Yarn Spinner, and creating a variety of puzzle and environment elements to be used throughout the world, as well as level design.</p>
            <p>In addition, I have also been going through all of the previously created prefabs and adding sounds.</p>
            <p>The biggest struggle with working on a project you weren't there to start is adapting to the project's code base and learning their standards and workflow. While it was certainly a challenge, it was also a tremendous opportunity to learn and grow as a programmer.</p>
            <p>The key takeaway this whole experience has given me is that when you're stuck, the best thing to do is ask for help, there's no reason to run in circles trying to troubleshoot if someone with the answers is just a quick message away.</p>
