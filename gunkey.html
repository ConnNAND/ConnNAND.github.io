            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>This game was made for Global Game Jam 2024 and for creating such a ridiculous idea I chose to pay a bit closer attention to making the primary mechanic feel fun, being emphasized with some silly sound design.</p>
            <p>In Gunkey, you play the role of a monkey who got his hands on a shotgun, flinging it around to kill evil bananas.</p>
            <p>I was responsible for creating the player controller, including the games primary mechanic: the physics-based aiming system.</p>
            <h1>Accomplishments & Lessons Learned</h1>
            <p>With the theme of the jam being "make me laugh", we chose to emphasize our wacky concept of a monkey with a gun by leaning into its ridiculousness. Monkeys aren't sensible enough to aim so we took it to the extreme and made it so in order to aim you need to flail yourself around, and the gun of choice was made to be a shotgun in order to aid the lack of aiming.</p>
            <p>All of the sounds other than the music and the gunshot are original recordings. We were able to gain access to a recording studio on campus and took I the time to plan out all of the foley myself and recorded it for the jam. There is an additional touch of detail with the monkey's screams getting more intense based on the rate of fire.</p>
