            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>This project came from my final game jam at SSU, and we decided to shake things up with how the spring game jam was managed. Instead of deciding on a theme ahead of time, we held an art contest, and the winning piece became the game jam theme. With this in mind, my group decided to abstract from the piece some of the key features we identified in it, there were themes of paranoia, disguise, hiding yourself, large prominent eyes from shadowy figures watching you, and we decided that we could put all of that into the umbrella idea of "big brother". Those two words, "big brother", shifted the way we started to brain storm. It lead us to where we ended up, playing as a big brother while escorting your little brother to the top of a big obstacle course.</p>
            <p>While the course may be trivial to you, your brother isn't quite as "gamer", so it's your job to make sure he gets to the top! He's a bit distractable, so using your mic, you can call to him to get his attention, or sit with him for a bit until he's ready to move on if you'd like him to be a bit more cooperative in the future. Be as evil or patient as you like! The choice is ultimately up to you.</p>
            <p>The idea itself didn't require any concrete setting, and with the core concept being inspired by Bennett Foddy's "Getting Over It", we decided that since it was going to be our last chance to jam together as a group at Shawnee, we would use assets from our old projects to relive some of our iconic jams in a fresh new way, kinda like a virtual museum! Even if some of the games featured didn't quite meet the expectations we originally hoped for them, this gave us a chance to spin the narrative around it into something we can look back on a little more fondly, and I certainly think we delivered.</p>
            <p>Each games section of the map has some sort of unique gimmick based on that game. Fear the Forgotten has a list of chores you need to complete before you can progress, Trash Lord makes you horde garbage until the pile is large enough to make the next jump, Gunkey has spinning arms to knock you off, and a shotgun ready to blow you off the stage, and Bubblequest has some bouncy bubbles ready to launch you to the next platform.</p>
            <p>While it may not be quite the "looker" start to finish, since we couldn't steal a full-time artist for this jam, we certainly put in the work to make it a complete experience, and I think we did this jam proud, going out with a bang. This particular game actually found itself a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP6XM2swiCA">speedrunner</a> after the completion of the jam.</p>
            <h1>Accomplishments & Lessons Learned</h1>
            <p>I am responsible for the AI of the brother, all of the sound design, and the level design for the Fear the Forgotten and Trash Lord segments. While the first and final segments may not be the most beautiful, I am very proud of what we managed to get done in such a small time frame.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest things I credit to the quality of this game is the fact that it only took a few hours for the core gameplay loop to be ironed out. In our other jams, we'd generally have our core 3 team members, plus a few newbies that were looking for a group. This resulted in a team that was too big for what we were building, leading to situations where we would need to wait for someone else to finish their work before we could move on, and only realizing too late when bugs would appear when we were finally able to put the pieces together. Since we kept our team small there were plenty of open tasks to take, and nothing important was on hold until the final day.</p>
            <p>It may not have the same level of polish as something like Root Force, but I genuinely believe that this may be the most consistently entertaining game jam we've put together. There's unique and interesting mechanics to engage with the whole way through, a real sense of progression, always something new around the corner, and nothing is drawn out just to fill time. While we may have made some decisions to irritate the player, nothing is meant to be unfair, and ultimately how you perform is up to you.</p>
