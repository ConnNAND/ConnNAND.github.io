            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>My group made Fear the Forgotten, a horror-ish game inspired by Phasmophobia and Who's Your Daddy where you play the role of a nun trying to manage your catholic orphanage, but the kids won't stay in bed because they're afraid of the monsters under their bed and in their closet! So, it's your job to show them that it's safe, but what if it wasn't?</p>
            <p>That was the original vision, but it didn't exactly end like that. Being a game jam, everyone had to work quick on whatever was available, but in doing that, most of the important work ended up getting done at the END, since everyone was stuck waiting for certain jobs to be finished and just did busywork in the mean time, so there are lots of interactions that CAN happen, but how integral they are to the game is... subjective.</p>

            <h1>Accomplishments & Lessons Learned</h1>
            <p>There were two things I did during this project. I wanted to focus solely on sound design, so those entire systems are my baby; the spatial panning if you're close to a wall, the muffled sounds for audio through walls, echoing when far away, as well as all the actual audio editing and conditions for playing.</p>
            <p>The other thing was being thrust into the position of project lead, primarily the management came up once people stopped finding tasks for themselves, but since I came up with the original idea, and I have the most experience with the engine, people naturally came to me when they had questions, and most of the time I was just squashing bugs and trying to make sure everything moved smoothly.</p>
            <p>I'm proud of the systems I worked on in this project, but as a whole the development lacked proper task prioritization, which is ultimately where the project fell short of it's original vision.</p>
