            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>Having one full semester to plan and create a turn-based strategy game, ReGuild is our unique spin on the formula. This served as a crash course for all the things that can go wrong if you don't plan for the future, and that lesson was well learned here.</p>
            <h1>Accomplishments & Lessons Learned</h1>
            <p>I was responsible for creating all the aspects of turn-based combat aside from the enemies. This includes the framework for taking turns, all of the UI during combat, the movement and stamina, as well as all of the spells and attacks.</p>
            <p>The primary setback of this project was that I had not met any of the people in my group until we began development, so I was very on-edge about stepping on peoples toes when pushing code to the repository, and was overly careful about having my work fit inside of what others were trying to do, rather than just getting the work done and moving on.</p>
            <p>Aspects of my code had been written two or three different times because there was a failure to communicate what was needed out of it or someone had started working on a system that it was incompatible with, even though what I had finished was already done or much further along. I lacked the confidence to have others work with me so I worked around them and the product suffered as a result.</p>
            <p>In the end we still managed to finish a satisfying game with a complete game loop, but the lessons I learned about working with others are some I will never forget.</p>
