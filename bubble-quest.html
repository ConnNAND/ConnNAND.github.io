            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>Bubble Quest is my submission for the 2025 Global Game Jam, and when we heard the theme of the jam was "bubble", we decided to make a walking-sim where you explore and interact with characters that have bubbly personalities, looking for a way out of your bubble.</p>
            <h1>Accomplishments & Lessons Learned</h1>
            <p>For a game jam, having fully voiced dialog what a big ask. The acting was about what you'd expect from a bunch of college kids only getting one take, but the actual playback was able to link directly into the dialog system, so implementation of it was fairly simple. My primary focus during the jam was in level design, specifically the first area.</p>
            <p>Our team was quite large considering the scope of the project, so everyone was able to choose one aspect to work on during the whole jam, mine was the opening area, with sound design also being delegated to me as I was the only team member to have experience with it.</p>
            <p>I put my full attention into Bubbleton and to making it unique and interesting, paying careful attention to keeping the density of information balanced to stay interesting as players would walk through, incorporating plenty of unique points of interest in an attempt to direct people around to all of the NPCs scattered about, as well as to prevent players from getting lost. As simple as the game is, this level is among my favorites I've been able to make.</p>
            <p>Projects are only finished after you stop working on them, and in that spirit, after the submission period had closed, I was rather unsatisfied with how the dialog system in our release functioned. It gave lots of us trouble when trying to work with the NPCs, so I was inspired to try writing my own, which eventually became the dialog system packaged in my Godot toolkit add-on. Some of the unfinished NPCs in Bubble Quest use the new dialog system now, however many of them are stuck with the old one.</p>
