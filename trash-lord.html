            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>Created for the university hosted SSU Jam for Spring 2024, Trash Lord has you collecting garbage to amass the largest trash pile in town, avoiding getting caught and recruiting some animal friends along the way.</p>
            <p>My contributions are seen in the sound design, animal and garbageman AI, UI/UX, trash items, trash cans, and trash pile.</p>
            <h1>Accomplishments & Lessons Learned</h1>
            <p>While I was able to work on a wide variety of systems during this project, from the player controller and interactions to AI, the feature I am most proud of is the dynamic ambient tones.</p>
            <p>As you walk around the map, the ambient tone you hear in the background changes depending on where you are, fading between the different tracks seamlessly. This goes a step further by adjusting the volume in your left and right ears separately depending on how close you are to a wall, making the ambience match the space you are in.</p>
            <p>I also spent a great deal of time working on the friendly AI, having rats steer themselves towards trash cans and pulling garbage back to base, as well as having pigeons alert you to locations of people and filled trash cans, where the locations are added to the players compass displayed at the top of the screen.</p>
