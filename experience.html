          <h1>Education</h1>
            <p>I'm a graduate of Shawnee State University, receiving a degree in Digital Simulation & Game Programming. During my time there, SSU had been ranked in the top 15 universities in the United States for this field by the Princeton Review.</p>
            <p>This formal education introduced me to many complex topics and helped develop skills in the computer science field, including courses covering data structures, operating systems, artificial intelligence, concurrency, networking, compiler design, and rendering computer graphics utilizing Vullkan. These classes also exposed me to various creation tools and programming languages like Python, C, C++, C#, HTML & CSS, Javascript, GLSL, Assembly, git, Perforce, Godot & GDScript, Unreal Engine 4 & 5, Unity, Blender, Maya, and the Adobe Suite, as well as audio engineering tools like Audacity, Reaper, Ableton, and experience recording with professional equipment.</p>
            <p>College served as a great opportunity to work with others and to practice working collaberatively on projects at different scales for class, but also recreationally during events like game jams. Tackling these projects introduced me to concepts like scrum, the agile workflow, and to tools like Trello and ClickUp, as well as keeping me aquainted with weekly stand-ups.</p>
            <p>Through these projects I have also gained plenty of management experience, taking part in meetings, but also organizing them, delegating work, and supporting others when they have questions or need assistance.</p>
