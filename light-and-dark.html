            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>Light & Dark is a top-down co-op platformer that gives you a variety of abilities to work with, including swapping places with your partner, moving faster over matching colored tiles, and entering a wisp form to move through your matching colored obstacles. It might be rough around the edges, but Light & Dark served as a fantastic starting point for understanding more complex systems and ideas, as well as how much goes on in the background of game engines.</p>
            <p>Light & Dark was made as a final assignment with three others in our first year of college. Being free to work on whatever we liked, and not really recognizing how group dynamics should function yet, I took the job of researching how networked multiplayer might be possible within PyGame, and in turn became the one responsible for translating everyone else's work into a format that would be functional using a server/client relationship.</p>
            <h1>Accomplishments & Lessons Learned</h1>
            <p>This game was made by me and three others, and none of us had any experience making a multiplayer game before. While it seemed like a good idea at the time, assigning one person to become the "network master" to adapt everyone else's code into something acceptable in a server-client relationship was not an even division of labor.</p>
            <p>I was the so-called network master, and ended up writing most of the code from scratch, with others code essentially only being used as a reference. I needed to put in some real overtime to keep up with everyone's contributions while teaching myself networking, but the knowledge I gained about websockets, packet transfers, and how to best structure your code for network multiplayer still comes in handy to this day.</p>
