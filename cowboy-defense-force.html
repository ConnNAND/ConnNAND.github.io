            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>This game was made for the 2023 Epic Mega Jam. Being Inspired by Call of Duty Zombies, Cowboy Defense Force has you face waves of enemies in a carefully controlled environment with nothing but your guns to keep them at bay.</p>
            <p>For this project I specifically chose to dive deep into trying to create thoughtful and intentional level design through kitbashing assets that were made available to us for the jam.</p>
            <p>Looking back there are always things you would choose to do differently, but I am satisfied with the work I managed to put out.</p>
            <h1>Accomplishments & Lessons Learned</h1>
            <p>This is one of the most lively scenes I have managed to create for a game. Focusing entirely on level design allowed me to utilize every inch of the map to make something that feels complete.</p>
            <p>During several points in development I actually realized I needed to scale things down, until eventually settling in on just a single building. This decision proved to be for the best and allowed me to focus on making one setting incredibly detailed instead of trying to fill out an entire map that would end up still feeling empty.</p>
            <p>Admittedly looking back it may have gotten a bit cramped, however I still managed to learn a ton about level design and how to make an environment interesting and engaging. I also learned that cutting back your scope and being adaptable can result in a much greater product than trying to overachieve.</p>
