            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>Isles of Aether is an action/adventure game with a focus on combat inspired by Dark Souls and Kingdom Hearts.</p>
            <p>Having my first long-term project in a large group helped better prepare me for the scrum development processes. It also allowed me to see what changes occur in workflow from the longer development period, which lead to much more iteration.</p>
            <h1>Accomplishments & Lessons Learned</h1>
            <p>Isles of Aether served as my introduction into the audio design world. Up until this project I had never made it the focus for any of my games, so I started completely lost as to what to do.</p>
            <p>While none of what I managed to accomplish in Isles of Aether may seem to shake the world or be technically impressive, it was an indispensable stepping stone in my journey to learning what I know now. It introduced me to concepts like ambient tones. It had me engage with Unreal Engine's MetaSounds, experimenting with ideas like procedural footsteps and dynamic collision sounds based on items materials.</p>
            <p>This project made me take a closer ear to other games as well, noting how they managed to get things across, have enemies that don't make your ears bleed, swords that sound impactful, and spells that accurately convey what is shown on screen. It may not seem like much, but this game was my sound design awakening that influenced all of my projects to come.</p>
